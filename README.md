# calculator
This is my first python GUI mini project using PyQt version 5.
The whole has been handwritten by me and the gui is not made using Qt software.
It is a basic calculator which performs 4 basic mathematical operations on 2 numbers.
Aim of this project is to get started with GUIs in python.
